  <b><i>Web Development Environment</i></b>

  <b><i>Keyboard Shortcuts and Workflows</i></b>
  <p>This is my summary of Keyboard Shortcuts and workflows</p>

  <b><i>Git Version Control</i></b>
  <p>I started by following the command line instructions to install Github Desktop on my laptop, then I learned how to edit and track changes (commits) in a published file from both my desktop and the web. During this process I created an account on Github.com, learned how to create a local repository via Github Desktop, then publish that local repository and open it on the web. I also learned how to edit the repository via the command line or Atom on my desktop, as well as how to edit the file on Github.com. I also learned how to fork a repository and clone it to my Github Desktop.</p>

  <h3>Web-based projects</h3>
  <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/">AI Dungeon</a>
  <p>AI Dungeon is an online multiplayer or single player game driven by artificial intelligence. The AI scrapes web based platforms such as reddit for story telling ideas, and generates a plot based on your responses to prompts or the new plot lines. You can play within multiple genres and each time you play the AI learns from how you respond. </p>
  <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos Graphing Calculator</a>
  <p>Desmos is an online graphing calculator that lets you graph functions, plot data, evaluate equations, explore transformations, and best of all, it lets you do it for free. My favorite function of Desmos is that it lets you know when your syntax is wrong, similar to how some coding softwares/programs work.</p>
  <a href="https://www.rhymezone.com/">Rhyme Zone</a>
  <p>Rhyme Zone lets you type in any word and returns a list of words that rhyme with it. It also sorts the outputs into syllabic categories so it is perfect for helping write lyrical compositions. It also incorporates near-rhymes as opposed to just true rhymes!</p>
